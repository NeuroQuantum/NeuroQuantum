- ⚡ Fun fact: Indian Mathematician, Brahmgupta, who invented negative numbers and gave us the rules for computation with number zero in 528 CE, had defined Multiplication with zero as Kha-guna (which has an inverse and not accepted today) and Division by Zero as Kha-har (again not accepted as Indeterminate) in his Sanskrit treatise BrahmSphutSiddhant.
